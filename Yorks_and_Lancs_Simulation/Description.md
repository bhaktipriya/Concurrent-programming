#The War of Roses 
The conflict between the Yorks and Lanncasters in Britain is famously remembered as the War of
Roses. Though both are descendants from the same bloodlines, they were invloved in a massive
struggle for power which lead to many wars.
Inn keepers have a real tough time during the wars, especially those whose inn lies in the battle
zone. But they are also the only source of good ale, and thus both the armies don't want to burn em
down. Hence, both the parties came to a treaty. The treaty was that at a given time no two soldiers
of different armies can be present inside the inn at the same time. Also, since the size of the inn is
not infinite, after the inn is full, others shall wait outside in line, without making any conflict. They
are encouraged to share songs amongst themselves, and have a laugh while they wait.
Each soldier is a thread, and is randomly to be assigned as a York or a Lanncaster.
The capacity of the inn will be given as input.
The above given scenario has been simulated, without causing any conflicts to the treaty.
No soldier is made to wait unnecesarily outside.
